# Welcome

## Motivation
Welcome to Mursic, a self-hosted music audio and video streaming website that offers a unique and personalized listening experience for music lovers. The motivation behind Mursic was to create a platform that allows users to stream audio and video content in a flexible and efficient way, without being tied to a specific streaming service or platform. 

## Tools
We wanted to provide a solution that allows users to host their own content, and have full control over their listening experience. We believe that there is no defined way to stream audio, and that's why we've created a platform that allows users to customize their streaming experience to their liking. Our frontend is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), which provides a fast, scalable, and secure user interface. The backend is built using [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/), a Rust-based web framework that provides a lightweight and efficient foundation for our platform. With Mursic, users can upload their own audio and video content, create playlists, and share their favorite tracks with others. Our platform also supports a wide range of audio formats, including MP3, AAC, and FLAC, ensuring that users can enjoy their music in the highest possible quality.
